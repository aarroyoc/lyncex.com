{% block content %}
<div>
<p>Lyncex is a collection of libraries and tools to enable a fast, correct and elegant use of Prolog for web development and modern software engineering. Based on ISO Prolog, we try to make an stable and free environment which allows people use Prolog and Logtalk for common software tasks (mainly web related). That way, we can use all the advantages of logic programming in real world.</p>
